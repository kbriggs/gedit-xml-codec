gedit-xml-codec
===============

A gedit plugin for XML-encoding/decoding blocks of text

Installation
------------

To install, copy or link the files `xmlcodec.plugin` and `xmlcodec.py` to your
`~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/` directory (which may need to be created). They
need to be in that exact directory; subdirectories are not scanned for plugins.
